# Risk

A small Haskell program which calculates the probability of an attacker winning an invasion in the Risk board game in two different ways (exact probability and Monte Carlo).
The game is implemented only once using Monads and used for both methods.
This program was written for a Haskell presentation given at Standard Chartered Bank with the aim of teaching basic Haskell concepts (type synonyms, data types, typeclasses, functors and monads).
